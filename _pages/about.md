Hello! I’m İrfan, a fresh Electrical and Electronics Engineer based in Türkiye, currently working towards finishing my Industrial Engineering double major. I value the benefits that having a professional proficient in many disciplines bring to any team. As such, I accumulated knowledge and skills in different fields from very young age. Examples to this include learning;
* software development at primary school level without any courses, guidance or supervision
* R and Julia for scientific programming and data analysis/visualisation in addition to MATLAB which was part of the undergraduate curriculum
* LaTeX to typeset documents
* Maple and Mathematica for symbolic equation solving and to author calculators/tools concerning Electronics Engineering design/analysis problems
* CAD software such as SOLIDWORKS to draw 3D printable equipment for experiments involving sensor hardware.
* Inkscape vector graphics editor software to edit details in documents and to create cheatsheets for exams :) by merging multiple sources of information.

I aspire to build a career in research where I firmly believe that I can put my multidisciplinary knowledge and acquaintance with tools concerning to those disciplines into good use. I aim to apply methods from different domains and to bridge professionals multiple disciplines. I am considered a quick learner who is always curious and looking to learn more. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity in the form of a graduate program abroad that would serve as preparation towards a PhD.

## Experiences
### Communications Electronics Engineering Intern at ASELSAN (Türkiye based defense corporation specialising in military electronics)<br>Ankara/Türkiye (08/22-09/22)
* Programmed C# and MATLAB software for measurement data collection with SCPI commands through VISA and data visualisation/analysis solutions.
* Developed firmware for an STM32 based communication equipment calibration board in C, including writing drivers for ICs/devices on the board and communicating components with SPI/I2C.

### Intern Researcher at Istanbul Technical University Aerospace Research Center<br>İstanbul/Türkiye (06/22-07/22)
* Worked with a research group to understand the quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) scientific model. In addition to bridging research teams and drafting reports, I led the battery selection team.
* Developed Simulink model to solve the Kinetic Battery Model. Successfully implemented the design on FPGA using HDL Coder and tuned the Simulink model according to Modelsim results to improve simulation performance.
* Verified & tested our design using Modelsim in conjunction with MATLAB and Simulink to automate the process. Explored the simulation performance by comparing two methods of arithmetic (floating point vs. fixed point).

## Background
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from MEF University in 2023 where I graduated 1st in class among Electrical and Electronics Engineering students. I was the student representative of the department between January 2021 - June 2023. I used to perform as undergraduate teaching assistant for different courses where I enjoyed assisting fellow students from different backgrounds and cultures with lab work while further refining my own skills.

My double major at MEF University BSc. in Industrial Engineering  is expected to finish in June 2024.
